# passenger-connect-web
The sourcecode Passenger Connect corporate website

## Development

- Install Ruby (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)

    n.b. For MacOS, using Ruby Version Manager is recommended
    
- Launch the site on a local server
   
   `cd passenger-connect-site`
   
   `bundle exec jekyll serve` _or_ `jekyll serve`
   
   This will spin up the local server and rebuild after changes are made in the code.
