# Jekyll test
The sourcecode corporate website

## Development

- Install Ruby (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)

    n.b. For MacOS, using Ruby Version Manager is recommended

- Launch the site on a local server

   `cd passenger-connect-site`

   `bundle exec jekyll serve` _or_ `jekyll serve`

   This will spin up the local server and rebuild after changes are made in the code.

-  Access the admin UI at `localhost:4000/admin` where you can manage posts and pages (note: this will not be accessible in production).


## File Structure
